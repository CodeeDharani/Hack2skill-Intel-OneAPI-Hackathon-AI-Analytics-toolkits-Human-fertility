                                                  A Multimodal Video Dataset of Human Spermatozoa.
Real multimedia datasets that contain more than just images or text are rare. Even more rare are open multimedia datasets in medicine. Often, clinically related datasets only consist of image or videos. Here, we present a dataset that is novel in two ways. Firstly, it is a multi-modal dataset containing different data sources such as videos, biological analysis data, and participant data. Secondly, it is the first dataset of that kind in the field of human reproduction. It consists of anonymized data from 85 different participants. We hope this dataset will inspire people to apply their knowledge in this important field, generate shareable results in the domain, and ultimately improve human infertility investigation and treatment.

Sperm-related data faces the same problems as other clinical datasets. First of all, it is often difficult to share data due to legal requirements. Secondly, the knowledge about what the data contains and which are interesting medical research questions are often hard to find for researchers not familiar with the field. Finally, datasets are often also small compared to what would be effective for a proper analysis and evaluation of the results. We try to tackle the above-mentioned challenges by providing a clinical dataset in an open and explained way to experts not familiar with the medical field. The goal is to encourage these researchers to explore a new and exciting medical domain and contribute to the society with their research. In addition, we encourage comparable and open research also in the medical field where data access is usually difficult and often restricted to a limited number of researchers. To the best of our knowledge, the dataset contains more samples and far more attributes per participant than any sperm dataset openly available today. The dataset opens up for a wide range of new and interesting analyses, and a proper and fair comparison between different methods, both from a medical and a multimedia perspective.

VISEM contains data from 85 male participants aged 18 years or older. For each of the participants, parameters from a standard semen analysis, a video of live spermatozoa, sperm fatty acid profile, the fatty acid composition of phospholipids of serum, demographic data and WHO analysis data are available. For some participants, two video files were made since there was a drift in the first sample recorded. This makes it difficult for the laboratory personnel to assess the motility. We decided to only include one video per participant due to dataset size concerns. The dataset contains over 35 gigabytes of videos, with each video lasting between two to seven minutes. The resolution of the videos is $640 \times 480$, and the frame-rate is 50 frames per second. The dataset contains in total six CSV-files (five for data and one for the video to participant ID mapping), a description file, and a video folder, Each of the video files is named with an ID, the date of video capture and a small optional description. Then, the end of the filename contains the code of the person who assessed the video using the WHO standard. Further, VISEM contains five CSV-files for each of the other data provided, a CSV-file with the IDs linked to each their video, and a text file containing descriptions of some of the columns of the CSV-files. One row in each CSV-file represents a participant.

The provided CSV-files are:

semen_analysis_data: The results of standard semen analysis.
fatty_acids_spermatozoa: The levels of several fatty acids in the spermatozoa of the participants.
fatty_acids_serum: The serum levels of the fatty acids of the phospholipids (measured from the blood of the participant).
sex_hormones: The serum levels of sex hormones measured in blood of the participants.
participant_related_data: General information about the participants such as age, abstinence time and Body Mass Index (BMI).
videos: Overview of which video-file belongs to what participant.

<p>
  Firstly, it is a multi-modal dataset containing different data sources such as videos, biological analysis data, and participant data. Secondly, it is the first dataset of that kind in the field of human reproduction. It consists of anonymized data from 85 different participants. We hope this dataset will inspire people to apply their knowledge in this important field, generate shareable results in the domain, and ultimately improve human infertility investigation and treatment.Sperm-related data faces the same problems as other clinical datasets.

<p>
  VISEM contains five CSV-files for each of the other data provided, a CSV-file with the IDs linked to each their video, and a text file containing descriptions of some of the columns of the CSV-files. One row in each CSV-file represents a participant.

The provided CSV-files are:

**Semen_analysis_data:** The results of standard semen analysis.<br /> 
**Fatty_acids_spermatozoa:** The levels of several fatty acids in the spermatozoa of the participants.<br />
**Fatty_acids_serum:** The serum levels of the fatty acids of the phospholipids (measured from the blood of the participant).<br />
**Sex_hormones:** The serum levels of sex hormones measured in blood of the participants.<br />
**Participant_related_data:** General information about the participants such as age, abstinence time and Body Mass Index (BMI).<br />
**Videos:** Overview of which video-file belongs to what participant.
